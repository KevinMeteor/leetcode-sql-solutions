# Window Functions

Window functions were a turning point in how I write analytical SQL.

They allow complex logic—such as ranking or top-N analysis—to be
expressed clearly without deeply nested subqueries.

This section focuses on patterns I commonly see in:
- Ranking reports
- User behavior analysis
- Per-group comparisons

Once you get comfortable with window functions, many problems
become easier to reason about.
