# Basic SELECT & JOIN

Most SQL problems start here.

This section contains queries that look simple at first glance,
but often fail in real projects due to incorrect join conditions
or misunderstood relationships between tables.

I use these problems to practice writing joins that are:
- Explicit
- Easy to read
- Safe from unintended row duplication

Getting this part right is critical before moving on to more
complex analytical queries.
