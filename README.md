# SQL Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository showcases my SQL skills for Data Analyst roles, 
with a focus on solving real-world analytical and business problems.

Rather than emphasizing algorithmic difficulty, 
the queries in this project demonstrate how SQL is used for:
- KPI reporting
- Financial aggregation
- User behavior analysis
- Time-based trend analysis

---

## 🧠 Core SQL Skills

- Multi-table JOINs and subqueries
- Aggregation and KPI calculation
- Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK)
- Time-based analysis (monthly metrics)
- Translating business questions into SQL logic

---

## 📂 Project Files

- **MySQL.sql**  
  SQL solutions written in MySQL syntax

- **SQLServer.sql**  
  Equivalent solutions adapted for SQL Server (T-SQL)

- **explanation.md**  
  Business context and analytical explanation for selected queries
